#Scottish Reps Forum

This would be a great place for all of the reps in Scotland to speak and to swap resources, ideas and share best practice with each other so 
we can be on point for our members when they really need us

I intend to set up a **free** forum where everyone will need to register with a **username and password.** This means the admin can
can refuse people who are not part of the union. 

We can set up branch specific catagories and/or interest specific catagories and this will be maintained by a group of interested 
people who can make sure reps abide by the rules
